Diamond Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Overview

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about diamonds.
The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding the factors affecting the price and quality of diamonds.

Introduction

In this project, I have performed EDA on a diamonds dataset to clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values and outliers, create visualization,
and analyze correlations between various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and price.

Dataset

The diamonds dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains the following features:

Carat
Cut
Color
Clarity
Depth
Table
Price
X, Y, Z (dimensions of the diamond)
Steps Involved

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data consistency.
Standardized the format of the data for uniformity.
Data Visualization:
Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate variable relationships and trends.
Visualized the distribution of various features and their relationships with the price.
Correlation Analysis:
Analyzed correlations between features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and price to identify significant relationships.
Used histograms to show distribution and scatter plots to represent the correlations.
Results

Identified key factors affecting the price of diamonds.
Observed trends and patterns in the data through visualizations.
Found significant correlations between features, providing insights into the characteristics that influence diamond pricing.
Conclusion

The EDA provided valuable insights into the diamonds dataset. By understanding the relationships between different features,
we can better predict diamond prices and make more informed decisions in the diamond industry.
